It's time to search the archival memory for details and background data to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the paper. Let's remember to page through results until I've gathered enough information to answer Chad's enquiry.\nâš¡ðŸ§  [function] searching memory with archival_memory_search\nðŸ’­ Based on the found results, MemGPT is an AI system designed for tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. It efficiently manages different tiers of storage to provide extended context within\nthe LLMâ€™s limited cap. Also, noteworthy from my findings is that MemGPT performs impressively in deep memory retrieval (DMR) and document QA tasks. Let's prepare a comprehensive response for Chad.\nðŸ¤– Certainly, Chad. MemGPT, or MemoryGPT, is a system specially designed for tasks like extended conversations and document analysis which are traditionally hindered by the limited context windows of modern \nLarge Language Models (LLMs). It uses a technique inspired by hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems, called virtual context management. This technique allows for an effective provision \nof extended context within an LLMâ€™s limited context window by intelligently managing different storage tiers, much like paging between physical memory and disk. Notably, MemGPT outperforms the fixed-context \nbaselines in deep memory retrieval and it's able to analyze large documents with precision.\n\n"],"headingContent":"MemGPT with Milvus Integration","anchorList":[{"label":"MemGPT with Milvus Integration","href":"MemGPT-with-Milvus-Integration","type":1,"isActive":false},{"label":"Configuration","href":"Configuration","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"Creating an external data source","href":"Creating-an-external-data-source","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"Attaching the data source to a MemGPT agent","href":"Attaching-the-data-source-to-a-MemGPT-agent","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"Testing out our new chatbot","href":"Testing-out-our-new-chatbot","type":2,"isActive":false}]}
