# Encryption in Transit

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is an encryption protocol to ensure communication security. Milvus proxy uses TLS one-way and two-way authentication.

This topic describes how to enable TLS in Milvus proxy for both gRPC and RESTful traffics.

<div class="alert note">

TLS and user authentication are two distinct security approaches. If you have enabled both user authentication and TLS in your Milvus system, you will need to provide a username, password, and certificate file paths. For information on how to enable user authentication, refer to [Authenticate User Access](authenticate.md).

</div>

## Create your own certificate

### Prerequisites

Make sure OpenSSL is installed. If you have not installed it, [build and install](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) OpenSSL first.

```shell
openssl version
```

If OpenSSL is not installed. It can be installed with the following command in Ubuntu.

```shell
sudo apt install openssl
```

### Create files

1. Create the `openssl.cnf` and `gen.sh` files.

```
mkdir cert && cd cert
touch openssl.cnf gen.sh
```

2. Copy the following configurations into the files respectively. 

<details><summary><code>openssl.cnf</code></summary>

# OpenSSL example configuration file.
# This is mostly being used for generation of certificate requests.
#

# This definition stops the following lines choking if HOME isn't
# defined.

# To use this configuration file with the "-extfile" option of the
# "openssl x509" utility, name here the section containing the
# X.509v3 extensions to use:
# extensions		= 
# (Alternatively, use a configuration file that has only
# X.509v3 extensions in its main [= default] section.)

# We can add new OIDs in here for use by 'ca', 'req' and 'ts'.
# Add a simple OID like this:

</details>

The `openssl.cnf` file is a default OpenSSL configuration file. See [manual page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man5/config.html) for more information. The `gen.sh` file generates relevant certificate files. You can modify the `gen.sh` file for different purposes such as changing the validity period of the certificate file, the length of the certificate key or the certificate file names.

It is necessary to configure the `CommonName` in the `gen.sh` file. The `CommonName` refers to the server name that the client should specify while connecting.

<details><summary><code>gen.sh</code></summary>

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# your variables
Country="CN"
State="Shanghai"
Location="Shanghai"
Organization="milvus"
Organizational="milvus"
CommonName="localhost"

echo "generate ca.key"
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048

echo "generate ca.pem"
openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.pem -days 3650 -subj "/C=$Country/ST=$State/L=$Location/O=$Organization/OU=$Organizational/CN=$CommonName"

echo "generate server SAN certificate"
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key
openssl req -new -nodes -key server.key -out server.csr -days 3650 -subj "/C=$Country/O=$Organization/OU=$Organizational/CN=$CommonName" -config ./openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -out server.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -extfile ./openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req

echo "generate client SAN certificate"
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client.key
openssl req -new -nodes -key client.key -out client.csr -days 3650 -subj "/C=$Country/O=$Organization/OU=$Organizational/CN=$CommonName" -config ./openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in client.csr -out client.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -extfile ./openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req

```
</details>

The variables in the `gen.sh` file are crucial to the process of creating a certificate signing request file. The first five variables are the basic signing information, including country, state, location, organization, organization unit. Caution is needed when configuring `CommonName` as it will be verified during client-server communication.

### Run `gen.sh` to generate certificate

Run the `gen.sh` file to create certificate.

```
chmod +x gen.sh
./gen.sh
```

The following nine files will be created: `ca.key`, `ca.pem`, `ca.srl`, `server.key`, `server.pem`, `server.csr`, `client.key`, `client.pem`, `client.csr`.

### Modify the detail of certificate files (optional)

After generating the certificate, you can modify the detail of the certificate files according to your own need.

The implementation of SSL or TSL mutual authentication involves a client, a server, and a certificate authority (CA). A CA is used to ensure that the certificate between a client and a server is legal.

Run `man openssl` or see [the openssl manual page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/) for more information about using the OpenSSL command.

1. Generate an RSA private key for the ca.

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key
```

2. Request CA certificate generation. 

You need to provide the basic information about the CA in this step. Choose the `x509` option to skip the request and directly generate a self-signing certificate.

```
openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.pem -days 3650 -subj "/C=$Country/ST=$State/L=$Location/O=$Organization/OU=$Organizational/CN=$CommonName"
```

You will get a `ca.pem` file , a CA certificate that can be used to generate client-server certificates after this step.

3. Generate a server private key. 

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key
```

You will get a `server.key` file after this step.

4. Generate a certificate signing request file.

You need to provide the required information about the server to generate a certificate signing request file.

```
openssl req -new -nodes -key server.key -out server.csr -days 3650 -subj "/C=$Country/O=$Organization/OU=$Organizational/CN=$CommonName" -config ./openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req
```

You will get a `server.csr` file after this step.

5. Sign the certificate.

Open the `server.csr`, the `ca.key` and the `ca.pem` files to sign the certificate. The `CAcreateserial` command option is used to create a CA serial number file if it does not exist. You will get an `aca.srl` file after choosing this command option.

```
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -out server.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -extfile ./openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req
```

## Set up a Milvus server with TLS

This section outlines the steps to configure a Milvus server with TLS encryption.

<div class="alert note">

This guide focuses on deployment using Docker Compose. For information on Milvus Operator deployment, refer to [Milvus Operator TLS documentation](https://github.com/zilliztech/milvus-operator/blob/main/docs/administration/security/encryption-in-transit.md).

</div>

### 1. Modify the Milvus server configuration

To enable TLS, set `common.security.tlsMode` in `milvus.yaml` to `1` (for one-way TLS) or `2` (for two-way TLS).

```yaml
tls:
  serverPemPath: /milvus/tls/server.pem
  serverKeyPath: /milvus/tls/server.key
  caPemPath: /milvus/tls/ca.pem

common:
  security:
    tlsMode: 1
```

Parameters:

- `serverPemPath`: The path to the server certificate file.
- `serverKeyPath`: The path to the server key file.
- `caPemPath`: The path to the CA certificate file.
- `tlsMode`: The TLS mode for encryption. Valid values:
  - `1`: One-way authentication, where only the server requires a certificate and the client verifies it. This mode requires `server.pem` and `server.key` from the server side, and `server.pem` from the client side.
  - `2`: Two-way authentication, where both the server and the client require certificates to establish a secure connection. This mode requires `server.pem`, `server.key`, and `ca.pem` from the server side, and `client.pem`, `client.key`, and `ca.pem` from the client side.

### 2. Map certificate files to the container

#### Prepare certificate files

Create a new folder named `tls` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml`. Copy the `server.pem`, `server.key`, and `ca.pem` into the `tls` folder. Place them in a directory structure as follows:

```
├── docker-compose.yml
├── milvus.yaml
└── tls
     ├── server.pem
     ├── server.key
     └── ca.pem
```

#### Update Docker Compose configuration

Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file to map the certificate file paths inside the container as shown below:

```yaml
  standalone:
    container_name: milvus-standalone
    image: milvusdb/milvus:latest
    command: ["milvus", "run", "standalone"]
    security_opt:
    - seccomp:unconfined
    environment:
      ETCD_ENDPOINTS: etcd:2379
      MINIO_ADDRESS: minio:9000
    volumes:
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/milvus:/var/lib/milvus
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/tls:/milvus/tls
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/milvus.yaml:/milvus/configs/milvus.yaml
```

#### Deploy Milvus using Docker Compose

Execute the following command to deploy Milvus:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Connect to the Milvus server with TLS

For SDK interactions, use the following setups depending on the TLS mode.

### One-way TLS connection

Provide the path to `server.pem` and ensure the `server_name` matches the `CommonName` configured in the certificate.
  
```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient

client = MilvusClient(
    uri="https://localhost:19530",
    secure=True,
    server_pem_path="path_to/server.pem",
    server_name="localhost"
)
```

### Two-way TLS connection

Provide paths to `client.pem`, `client.key`, and `ca.pem`, and ensure the `server_name` matches the `CommonName` configured in the certificate.

```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient

client = MilvusClient(
    uri="https://localhost:19530",
    secure=True,
    client_pem_path="path_to/client.pem",
    client_key_path="path_to/client.key",
    ca_pem_path="path_to/ca.pem",
    server_name="localhost"
)
```

See [example_tls1.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/master/examples/example_tls1.py) and [example_tls2.py](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/master/examples/example_tls2.py) for more information.

## Connect to the Milvus RESTful server with TLS

For RESTful APIs, you can check tls by using the `curl` command.

### One-way TLS connection

```bash
curl --cacert path_to/ca.pem https://localhost:19530/v2/vectordb/collections/list
```

### Two-way TLS connection

```bash
curl --cert path_to/client.pem --key path_to/client.key --cacert path_to/ca.pem https://localhost:19530/v2/vectordb/collections/list
```
