# Lowercase​

The `lowercase` filter converts terms generated by a tokenizer to lowercase, making searches case-insensitive. For example, it can convert `["High", "Performance", "Vector", "Database"]` to `["high", "performance", "vector", "database"]`.​

## Configuration​

The `lowercase` filter is built into Milvus. To use it, simply specify its name in the `filter` section within `analyzer_params`.​

```python
analyzer_params = {​
    "tokenizer": "standard",​
    "filter": ["lowercase"],​
}​
```

The `lowercase` filter operates on the terms generated by the tokenizer, so it must be used in combination with a tokenizer.

After defining `analyzer_params`, you can apply them to a `VARCHAR` field when defining a collection schema. This allows Milvus to process the text in that field using the specified analyzer for efficient tokenization and filtering. For details, refer to [Example use](analyzer-overview.md#Example-use).​

## Example output​

Here’s an example of how the `lowercase` filter processes text:​

**Original text**:​

```python
"The Lowercase Filter Ensures Uniformity In Text Processing."​
```

**Expected output**:​

```python
["the", "lowercase", "filter", "ensures", "uniformity", "in", "text", "processing"]​
```
