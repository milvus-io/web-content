[DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) enables developers to build and scale AI applications with high-performance language models. It offers efficient inference, flexible APIs, and advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures for robust reasoning and retrieval tasks.  

In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Milvus and DeepSeek.



## Preparation
### Dependencies and Environment


```python
! pip install --upgrade pymilvus[model] openai requests tqdm
```

> If you are using Google Colab, to enable dependencies just installed, you may need to **restart the runtime** (click on the "Runtime" menu at the top of the screen, and select "Restart session" from the dropdown menu).

DeepSeek enables the OpenAI-style API. You can login to its official website and prepare the [api key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` as an environment variable.


```python
import os

os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"] = "***********"
```

### Prepare the data

We use the FAQ pages from the [Milvus Documentation 2.4.x](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-docs/releases/download/v2.4.6-preview/milvus_docs_2.4.x_en.zip) as the private knowledge in our RAG, which is a good data source for a simple RAG pipeline.

Download the zip file and extract documents to the folder `milvus_docs`.


```python
! wget https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-docs/releases/download/v2.4.6-preview/milvus_docs_2.4.x_en.zip
! unzip -q milvus_docs_2.4.x_en.zip -d milvus_docs
```

We load all markdown files from the folder `milvus_docs/en/faq`. For each document, we just simply use "# " to separate the content in the file, which can roughly separate the content of each main part of the markdown file.


```python
from glob import glob

text_lines = []

for file_path in glob("milvus_docs/en/faq/*.md", recursive=True):
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        file_text = file.read()

    text_lines += file_text.split("# ")
```

### Prepare the LLM and Embedding Model

DeepSeek enables the OpenAI-style API, and you can use the same API with minor adjustments to call the LLM.


```python
from openai import OpenAI

deepseek_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"],
    base_url="https://api.deepseek.com",
)
```

Define a embedding model to generate text embeddings using the `milvus_model`. We use the `DefaultEmbeddingFunction` model as an example, which is a pre-trained and lightweight embedding model.


```python
from pymilvus import model as milvus_model

embedding_model = milvus_model.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()
```

Generate a test embedding and print its dimension and first few elements.


```python
test_embedding = embedding_model.encode_queries(["This is a test"])[0]
embedding_dim = len(test_embedding)
print(embedding_dim)
print(test_embedding[:10])
```

     -0.03041712 -0.02269499 -0.02317863 -0.00426028]


## Load data into Milvus

### Create the Collection


```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient

milvus_client = MilvusClient(uri="./milvus_demo.db")

collection_name = "my_rag_collection"
```

> As for the argument of `MilvusClient`:
> - Setting the `uri` as a local file, e.g.`./milvus.db`, is the most convenient method, as it automatically utilizes [Milvus Lite](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus_lite.md) to store all data in this file.
> - If you have large scale of data, you can set up a more performant Milvus server on [docker or kubernetes](https://milvus.io/docs/quickstart.md). In this setup, please use the server uri, e.g.`http://localhost:19530`, as your `uri`.
> - If you want to use [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud), the fully managed cloud service for Milvus, adjust the `uri` and `token`, which correspond to the [Public Endpoint and Api key](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/on-zilliz-cloud-console#free-cluster-details) in Zilliz Cloud.

Check if the collection already exists and drop it if it does.


```python
if milvus_client.has_collection(collection_name):
    milvus_client.drop_collection(collection_name)
```

Create a new collection with specified parameters. 

If we don't specify any field information, Milvus will automatically create a default `id` field for primary key, and a `vector` field to store the vector data. A reserved JSON field is used to store non-schema-defined fields and their values.


```python
milvus_client.create_collection(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    dimension=embedding_dim,
    metric_type="IP",  # Inner product distance
    consistency_level="Strong",  # Supported values are (`"Strong"`, `"Session"`, `"Bounded"`, `"Eventually"`). See https://milvus.io/docs/consistency.md#Consistency-Level for more details.
)
```

### Insert data
Iterate through the text lines, create embeddings, and then insert the data into Milvus.

Here is a new field `text`, which is a non-defined field in the collection schema. It will be automatically added to the reserved JSON dynamic field, which can be treated as a normal field at a high level.


```python
from tqdm import tqdm

data = []

doc_embeddings = embedding_model.encode_documents(text_lines)

for i, line in enumerate(tqdm(text_lines, desc="Creating embeddings")):
    data.append({"id": i, "vector": doc_embeddings[i], "text": line})

milvus_client.insert(collection_name=collection_name, data=data)
```

## Build RAG

### Retrieve data for a query

Let's specify a frequent question about Milvus.


```python
question = "How is data stored in milvus?"
```

Search for the question in the collection and retrieve the semantic top-3 matches.


```python
search_res = milvus_client.search(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    data=embedding_model.encode_queries(
        [question]
    ),  # Convert the question to an embedding vector
    limit=3,  # Return top 3 results
    search_params={"metric_type": "IP", "params": {}},  # Inner product distance
    output_fields=["text"],  # Return the text field
)
```

Let's take a look at the search results of the query



```python
import json

retrieved_lines_with_distances = [
    (res["entity"]["text"], res["distance"]) for res in search_res[0]
]
print(json.dumps(retrieved_lines_with_distances, indent=4))
```

    [
        [
            " Where does Milvus store data?\n\nMilvus deals with two types of data, inserted data and metadata. \n\nInserted data, including vector data, scalar data, and collection-specific schema, are stored in persistent storage as incremental log. Milvus supports multiple object storage backends, including [MinIO](https://min.io/), [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage?hl=en#object-storage-for-companies-of-all-sizes) (GCS), [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs), [Alibaba Cloud OSS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/object-storage-service), and [Tencent Cloud Object Storage](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/cos) (COS).\n\nMetadata are generated within Milvus. Each Milvus module has its own metadata that are stored in etcd.\n\n###",
            0.6572665572166443
        ],
        [
            "How does Milvus flush data?\n\nMilvus returns success when inserted data are loaded to the message queue. However, the data are not yet flushed to the disk. Then Milvus' data node writes the data in the message queue to persistent storage as incremental logs. If `flush()` is called, the data node is forced to write all data in the message queue to persistent storage immediately.\n\n###",
            0.6312146186828613
        ],
        [
            "How does Milvus handle vector data types and precision?\n\nMilvus supports Binary, Float32, Float16, and BFloat16 vector types.\n\n- Binary vectors: Store binary data as sequences of 0s and 1s, used in image processing and information retrieval.\n- Float32 vectors: Default storage with a precision of about 7 decimal digits. Even Float64 values are stored with Float32 precision, leading to potential precision loss upon retrieval.\n- Float16 and BFloat16 vectors: Offer reduced precision and memory usage. Float16 is suitable for applications with limited bandwidth and storage, while BFloat16 balances range and efficiency, commonly used in deep learning to reduce computational requirements without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\n###",
            0.6115777492523193
        ]
    ]


### Use LLM to get a RAG response

Convert the retrieved documents into a string format.


```python
context = "\n".join(
    [line_with_distance[0] for line_with_distance in retrieved_lines_with_distances]
)
```

Define system and user prompts for the Lanage Model. This prompt is assembled with the retrieved documents from Milvus.


```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
Human: You are an AI assistant. You are able to find answers to the questions from the contextual passage snippets provided.
"""
USER_PROMPT = f"""
Use the following pieces of information enclosed in <context> tags to provide an answer to the question enclosed in <question> tags.
<context>
{context}
</context>
<question>
{question}
</question>
"""
```

Use the `deepseek-chat` model provided by DeepSeek to generate a response based on the prompts.


```python
response = deepseek_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-chat",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": USER_PROMPT},
    ],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

    In Milvus, data is stored in two main categories: inserted data and metadata.
    
    1. **Inserted Data**: This includes vector data, scalar data, and collection-specific schema. The inserted data is stored in persistent storage as incremental logs. Milvus supports various object storage backends for this purpose, such as MinIO, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Azure Blob Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS, and Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS).
    
    2. **Metadata**: Metadata is generated within Milvus and is specific to each Milvus module. This metadata is stored in etcd, a distributed key-value store.
    
    Additionally, when data is inserted, it is first loaded into a message queue, and Milvus returns success at this stage. The data is then written to persistent storage as incremental logs by the data node. If the `flush()` function is called, the data node is forced to write all data in the message queue to persistent storage immediately.


Great! We have successfully built a RAG pipeline with Milvus and DeepSeek.
