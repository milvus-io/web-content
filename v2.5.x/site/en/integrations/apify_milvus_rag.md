# Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Crawling Websites with Apify and Saving Data to Milvus for Question Answering

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/milvus-io/bootcamp/blob/master/bootcamp/tutorials/integration/apify_milvus_rag.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

This tutorial explains how to crawl websites using Apify's Website Content Crawler and save the data into Milvus/Zilliz vector database to be later used for question answering.

[Apify](https://apify.com/) is a web scraping and data extraction platform that offers an app marketplace with over two thousand ready-made cloud tools, known as Actors. These tools are ideal for use cases such as extracting structured data from e-commerce websites, social media, search engines, online maps, and more.

For example, the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor can deeply crawl websites, clean their HTML by removing a cookies modal, footer, or navigation, and then transform the HTML into Markdown.

The Apify integration for Milvus/Zilliz makes it easy to upload data from the web to the vector database.

# Before you begin

Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following:

- an Apify account and [APIFY_API_TOKEN](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api).

- an OpenAI account and [OPENAI_API_KEY](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)

- A [Zilliz Cloud account](https://cloud.zilliz.com) (a fully managed cloud service for Milvus).
- The Zilliz database URI and Token


## Install dependencies


```python
$ pip install --upgrade --quiet  apify==1.7.2 langchain-core==0.3.5 langchain-milvus==0.1.5 langchain-openai==0.2.0
```

## Set up Apify and Open API keys

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ["APIFY_API_TOKEN"] = getpass("Enter YOUR APIFY_API_TOKEN")
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Enter YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

    Enter YOUR APIFY_API_TOKEN··········
    Enter YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY··········


## Set up Milvus/Zilliz URI, token and collection name

You need the URI and Token of your Milvus/Zilliz to setup the client.

- If you have self-deployed Milvus server on [Docker or Kubernetes](https://milvus.io/docs/quickstart.md), use the server address and port as your uri, e.g.`http://localhost:19530`. If you enable the authentication feature on Milvus, use "<your_username>:<your_password>" as the token, otherwise leave the token as empty string.
- If you use [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud), the fully managed cloud service for Milvus, adjust the `uri` and `token`, which correspond to the [Public Endpoint and API key](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/on-zilliz-cloud-console#cluster-details) in Zilliz Cloud.

Note that the collection does not need to exist beforehand. It will be automatically created when data is uploaded to the database.

```python
os.environ["MILVUS_URI"] = getpass("Enter YOUR MILVUS_URI")
os.environ["MILVUS_TOKEN"] = getpass("Enter YOUR MILVUS_TOKEN")

MILVUS_COLLECTION_NAME = "apify"
```

    Enter YOUR MILVUS_URI··········
    Enter YOUR MILVUS_TOKEN··········


## Using the Website Content Crawler to scrape text content from Milvus.io

Next, we'll use the Website Content Crawler with the Apify Python SDK. We'll start by defining the actor_id and run_input, then specify the information that will be saved to the vector database.

The `actor_id="apify/website-content-crawler"` is the identifier for the Website Content Crawler. The crawler's behavior can be fully controlled via the run_input parameters (see the [input page](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler/input-schema) for more details). In this example, we’ll be crawling the Milvus documentation, which doesn’t require JavaScript rendering. Therefore, we set `crawlerType=cheerio`, define `startUrls`, and limit the number of crawled pages by setting `maxCrawlPages=10`.


```python
from apify_client import ApifyClient

client = ApifyClient(os.getenv("APIFY_API_TOKEN"))

actor_id = "apify/website-content-crawler"
run_input = {
    "crawlerType": "cheerio",
    "maxCrawlPages": 10,
    "startUrls": [{"url": "https://milvus.io/"}, {"url": "https://zilliz.com/"}],
}

actor_call = client.actor(actor_id).call(run_input=run_input)
```

The Website Content Crawler will thoroughly crawl the site until it reaches the predefined limit set by `maxCrawlPages`. The scraped data will be stored in a `Dataset` on the Apify platform. To access and analyze this data, you can use the `defaultDatasetId`


```python
dataset_id = actor_call["defaultDatasetId"]
dataset_id
```


    'P9dLFfeJAljlePWnz'



The following code fetches the scraped data from the Apify `Dataset` and displays the first scraped website


```python
item = client.dataset(dataset_id).list_items(limit=1).items
item[0].get("text")
```

To upload data into the Milvus database, we use the [Apify Milvus integration](https://apify.com/apify/milvus-integration). First, we need to set up the parameter for the Milvus database. Next, we select the fields (`datasetFields`) that we want to store in the database. In the example below, we are saving the `text` field and `metadata.title`.


```python
milvus_integration_inputs = {
    "milvusUri": os.getenv("MILVUS_URI"),
    "milvusToken": os.getenv("MILVUS_TOKEN"),
    "milvusCollectionName": MILVUS_COLLECTION_NAME,
    "datasetFields": ["text", "metadata.title"],
    "datasetId": actor_call["defaultDatasetId"],
    "performChunking": True,
    "embeddingsApiKey": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    "embeddingsProvider": "OpenAI",
}
```

Now, we'll call the `apify/milvus-integration` to store the data


```python
actor_call = client.actor("apify/milvus-integration").call(
    run_input=milvus_integration_inputs
)
```

All the scraped data is now stored in the Milvus database and is ready for retrieval and question answering

# Retrieval and LLM generative pipeline

Next, we'll define the retrieval-augmented pipeline using Langchain. The pipeline works in two stages:

- Vectorstore (Milvus): Langchain retrieves relevant documents from Milvus by matching query embeddings with stored document embeddings.
- LLM Response: The retrieved documents provide context for the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate an informed answer.

For more details about the RAG chain, please refer to the [Langchain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/).


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_milvus.vectorstores import Milvus
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")

vectorstore = Milvus(
    connection_args={
        "uri": os.getenv("MILVUS_URI"),
        "token": os.getenv("MILVUS_TOKEN"),
    },
    embedding_function=embeddings,
    collection_name=MILVUS_COLLECTION_NAME,
)

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["context", "question"],
    template="Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, "
    "just say that you don't know. \nQuestion: {question} \nContext: {context} \nAnswer:",
)


def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


rag_chain = (
    {
        "context": vectorstore.as_retriever() | format_docs,
        "question": RunnablePassthrough(),
    }
    | prompt
    | ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

Once we have the data in the database, we can start asking questions

---




```python
question = "What is Milvus database?"

rag_chain.invoke(question)
```




    'Milvus is an open-source vector database specifically designed for billion-scale vector similarity search. It facilitates efficient management and querying of vector data, which is essential for applications involving unstructured data, such as AI and machine learning. Milvus allows users to perform operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and vector searches, making it a powerful tool for handling large datasets.'



# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to crawl website content using Apify, store the data in a Milvus vector database, and use a retrieval-augmented pipeline to perform question-answering tasks. By combining Apify's web scraping capabilities with Milvus/Zilliz for vector storage and Langchain for language models, you can build highly effective information retrieval systems.

To improve data collection and updates in the database, the Apify integration offers [incremental updates](https://apify.com/apify/milvus-integration#incrementally-update-database-from-the-website-content-crawler), which updates only new or modified data based on checksums. Additionally, it can automatically [remove outdated](https://apify.com/apify/milvus-integration#delete-outdated-expired-data) data that hasn't been crawled within a specified time. These features help keep your vector database optimized and ensure that your retrieval-augmented pipeline remains efficient and up-to-date with minimal manual effort.
