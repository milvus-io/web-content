# What is Milvus?

Milvus is a high-performance, highly scalable vector database that runs efficiently across a wide range of environments, from a laptop to large-scale distributed systems. It is available as both open-source software and a cloud service.

Milvus is an open-source project under LF AI & Data Foundation distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. Most contributors are experts from the high-performance computing (HPC) community, specializing in building large-scale systems and optimizing hardware-aware code. Core contributors include professionals from Zilliz, ARM, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Meta, IBM, Salesforce, Alibaba, and Microsoft.

## Unstructured Data, Embeddings, and Milvus

Unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, varies in format and carries rich underlying semantics, making it challenging to analyze. To manage this complexity, embeddings are used to convert unstructured data into numerical vectors that capture its essential characteristics. These vectors are then stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable searches and analytics.

Milvus offers robust data modeling capabilities, enabling you to organize your unstructured or multi-modal data into structured collections. It supports a wide range of data types for different attribute modeling, including common numerical and character types, various vector types, arrays, sets, and JSON, saving you from the effort of maintaining multiple database systems.

Milvus offers three deployment modes, covering a wide range of data scales—from local prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks to massive Kubernetes clusters managing tens of billions of vectors:

- Milvus Lite is a Python library that can be easily integrated into your applications. As a lightweight version of Milvus, it’s ideal for quick prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running on edge devices with limited resources. [Learn more](milvus_lite.md).
- Milvus Standalone is a single-machine server deployment, with all components bundled into a single Docker image for convenient deployment. [Learn more](install_standalone-docker.md).
- Milvus Distributed can be deployed on Kubernetes clusters, featuring a cloud-native architecture designed for billion-scale or even larger scenarios. This architecture ensures redundancy in critical components. [Learn more](install_cluster-milvusoperator.md).

## What Makes Milvus so Fast？

Milvus was designed from day one to be a highly efficient vector database system. In most cases, Milvus outperforms other vector databases by 2-5x (see the VectorDBBench results). This high performance is the result of several key design decisions:

**Hardware-aware Optimization**: To accommodate Milvus in various hardware environments, we have optimized its performance specifically for many hardware architectures and platforms, including AVX512, SIMD, GPUs, and NVMe SSD.

**Advanced Search Algorithms**: Milvus supports a wide range of in-memory and on-disk indexing/search algorithms, including IVF, HNSW, DiskANN, and more, all of which have been deeply optimized. Compared to popular implementations like FAISS and HNSWLib, Milvus delivers 30%-70% better performance.

**Search Engine in C++**: Over 80% of a vector database's performance is determined by its search engine. Milvus uses C++ for this critical component due to the language's high performance, low-level optimization, and efficient resource management. Most importantly, Milvus integrates numerous hardware-aware code optimizations, ranging from assembly-level vectorization to multi-thread parallelization and scheduling, to fully leverage hardware capabilities. 

**Column-Oriented**: Milvus is a column-oriented vector database system. The primary advantages come from the data access patterns. When performing queries, a column-oriented database reads only the specific fields involved in the query, rather than entire rows, which greatly reduces the amount of data accessed. Additionally, operations on column-based data can be easily vectorized, allowing for operations to be applied in the entire columns at once, further enhancing performance.

## What Makes Milvus so Scalable

In 2022, Milvus supported billion-scale vectors, and in 2023, it scaled up to tens of billions with consistent stability, powering large-scale scenarios for over 300 major enterprises, including Salesforce, PayPal, Shopee, Airbnb, eBay, NVIDIA, IBM, AT&T, LINE, ROBLOX, Inflection, etc.

Milvus's cloud-native and highly decoupled system architecture ensures that the system can continuously expand as data grows:

Milvus itself is fully stateless so it can be easily scaled with the help of Kubernetes or public clouds. In addition, Milvus components are well decoupled, with the three most critical tasks—search, data insertion, and indexing/compaction—designed as easily parallelized processes, with complex logic separated out. This ensures that the corresponding query node, data node, and index node can scale both up and out independently, optimizing performance and cost efficiency.

## Types of Searches Supported by Milvus

Milvus supports various types of search functions to meet the demands of different use cases:

- [ANN Search](single-vector-search.md#Basic-search): Finds the top K vectors closest to your query vector.
- [Filtering Search](single-vector-search.md#Filtered-search): Performs ANN search under specified filtering conditions.
- [Range Search](single-vector-search.md#Range-search): Finds vectors within a specified radius from your query vector.
- [Hybrid Search](multi-vector-search.md): Conducts ANN search based on multiple vector fields.
- Keyword Search: Keyword search based on BM25.
- [Reranking](reranking.md): Adjusts the order of search results based on additional criteria or a secondary algorithm, refining the initial ANN search results.
- [Fetch](get-and-scalar-query.md#Get-Entities-by-ID): Retrieves data by their primary keys.
- [Query](get-and-scalar-query.md#Use-Basic-Operators): Retrieves data using specific expressions.
