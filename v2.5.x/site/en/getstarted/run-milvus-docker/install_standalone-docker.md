# Run Milvus in Docker

This page illustrates how to launch a Milvus instance in Docker.


## Prerequisites

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- [Check the requirements for hardware and software](prerequisite-docker.md) prior to your installation.


## Install Milvus in Docker

Milvus provides an installation script to install it as a docker container. The script is available in the [Milvus repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/scripts/standalone_embed.sh). To install Milvus in Docker, just run

```shell
# Download the installation script
$ curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/scripts/standalone_embed.sh -o standalone_embed.sh

# Start the Docker container
$ bash standalone_embed.sh start
```

After running the installation script:

- A docker container named milvus has been started at port **19530**.
- An embed etcd is installed along with Milvus in the same container and serves at port **2379**. Its configuration file is mapped to **embedEtcd.yaml** in the current folder.
- To change the default Milvus configuration, add your settings to the **user.yaml** file in the current folder and then restart the service.
- The Milvus data volume is mapped to **volumes/milvus** in the current folder.

You can stop and delete this container as follows

```shell
# Stop Milvus
$ bash standalone_embed.sh stop

# Delete Milvus data
$ bash standalone_embed.sh delete
```
You can upgrade the latest version Milvus as follows

```shell
# upgrade Milvus
$ bash standalone_embed.sh upgrade
```
