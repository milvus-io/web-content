# Users, Privileges, and Roles

This topic provides an overview of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Milvus, detailing the definitions and relationships between users, roles, objects, and privileges.

The following figure illustrates the relationship between objects, privileges, roles, and users.

## Key concepts

To manage access control to Milvus resources, itâ€™s important to understand the key components of RBAC: object types, object names, users, roles, and privileges.

- **Object type**: the category of the object for which a privilege is being assigned. The object type can be:
  - `Global`: System-wide objects, allowing the user to perform actions that affect all collections, users, or system-wide settings.
  - `Collection`: Collection-specific objects, allowing the user to perform actions such as creating indexes, loading data, inserting or deleting data, and querying data within a specific collection.
  - `User`: Objects related to user management, allowing the user to manage credentials and roles for database users, such as updating user credentials or viewing user details.

- **Object name**: the specific name of the object to control access for. For instance:
  - If the object type is `Global`, the object name must be set to the wildcard (`*`), indicating all objects of the specified type.
  - If the object type is `Collection`, the object name is the name of a collection.
  - If the object type is `User`, the object name is the name of a database user.

- **User**: a person or an application that interacts with Milvus, which consists of a username and a corresponding password.

- **Privilege**: defines the actions that can be performed and the resources that can be accessed. Privileges are not granted directly to users but are assigned to roles.

- **Role**: defines the set of privileges that a user has for certain objects. Once a role is bound to a user, the user inherits all the privileges granted to that role.

## Example: Granting privileges

The following code snippet shows how to grant a `CreateIndex` privilege to a role on a specific collection:

<div class="multipleCode">
    <a href="#python">Python </a>
    <a href="#java">Java</a>
    <a href="#javascript">Node.js</a>
</div>

```python
milvusClient.grant_privilege(
    role_name="CUSTOM_ROLE_NAME",
    object_type="Collection",  # Valid value: Global, Collection or User.
    privilege="CreateIndex",   # See the table below for valid privilege names and relevant API descriptions.
    object_name="YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME"  # The name of the collection to grant access to. Use "*" to grant access to all collections.
)
```

```java
GrantPrivilegeReq grantPrivilegeReq = GrantPrivilegeReq.builder()
        .roleName("roleName")
        .objectName("CollectionName") // The name of the collection to grant access to. Use "*" to grant access to all collections.
        .objectType("Collection") // Valid value: Global, Collection or User.
        .privilege("CreateIndex") // See the table below for valid privilege names and relevant API descriptions.
        .build();
client.grantPrivilege(grantPrivilegeReq);
```

```javascript
milvusClient.grantPrivilege({
   roleName: 'roleName',
   object: 'Collection',  // Valid value: Global, Collection or User.
   objectName: 'CollectionName', // The name of the collection to grant access to. Use "*" to grant access to all collections.
   privilegeName: 'CreateIndex' // See the table below for valid privilege names and relevant API descriptions.
 })
```

## Default users and roles

Milvus creates a `root` user by default with a default password `Milvus`. The `root` user is granted the `admin` privileges, which means that this `root` user can have access to all resources and perform all actions.

If a user is associated with the `public` role, they are entitled to the following privileges:

- `DescribeCollection`
- `ShowCollections`
- `IndexDetail`

## List of object types and privileges

The following table lists the values you can choose when [enabling RBAC](rbac.md).

<div class="alert note">
<li>Object and privilege names are case-sensitive.</li>
<li>To grant all privileges to a kind of object, like Collection, Global, User, use "*" for privilege name. </li>
<li>The "*" privilege name for the Global object doesn't include the All privilege, because the All privilege includes all permissions, including any collection and user object.</li>
