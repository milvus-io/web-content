# Template for Conceptual Docs 

Please provide the general information of the system/concept/feature you introduce.

## Provide as much relevant information

as the user may need to understand. Use [hyperlink](url-of-a-page) when necessary.

## Use plain and succinct sentence in reference docs

to make it more understandable to users.

## Use tables to compare things or provide information that categorized in groups

|              | First Item | Second Item |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Difference A |            |             |
| Difference B |            |             |



## Use lists to provide sequential information

This is an unordered list:

- Statement 1
  - Sub-statement 1
  - Sub-statement 2
- Statement 2
- ...

This is an ordered list:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. ...



## Use graphs, charts, and pictures when words are insufficient to explain
