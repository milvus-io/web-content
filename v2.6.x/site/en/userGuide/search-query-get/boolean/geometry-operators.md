# Geometry Operators

Milvus supports a set of operators for spatial filtering on `GEOMETRY` fields, which are essential for managing and analyzing geometric data. These operators allow you to retrieve entities based on the geometric relationships between objects.

All geometry operators function by taking two geometric arguments: the name of the `GEOMETRY` field defined in your collection schema and a target geometry object represented in [Well-Known Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) (WKT) format.

To learn more about `GEOMETRY` fields in Milvus, refer to [Geometry Field](geometry-field.md).

## Supported geometry operators

The following table lists the geometry operators available in Milvus.

Operator names must be **all uppercase** or **all lowercase**. Do not mix cases within the same operator name.

## ST_EQUALS / st_equals

The `ST_EQUALS` operator returns TRUE if two geometries are spatially identical, meaning they have the same set of points and dimension. This is useful for verifying if two stored geometry objects represent exactly the same location and shape.

**Example**

Suppose you want to check whether a stored geometry (such as a point or polygon) is exactly the same as a target geometry. For instance, you can compare a stored point to a specific point of interest.

```python
# The filter expression to check if a geometry matches a specific point
filter = "ST_EQUALS(geo_field, 'POINT(10 20)')"
```

## ST_CONTAINS / st_contains

The `ST_CONTAINS` operator returns TRUE if the first geometry completely contains the second geometry. This is useful for finding points within a polygon, or smaller polygons within a larger one.

**Example**

Imagine you have a collection of city districts and want to find a specific point of interest, such as a restaurant, that falls within the boundaries of a given district.

```python
# The filter expression to find geometries completely within a specific polygon.
filter = "ST_CONTAINS(geo_field, 'POLYGON ((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))')"
```

## ST_CROSSES / st_crosses

The `ST_CROSSES` operator returns `TRUE` if the intersection of two geometries forms a geometry with a lower dimension than the original geometries. This typically applies to a line crossing a polygon or another line.

**Example**

You want to find all hiking trails (line strings) that cross a specific boundary line (another line string) or enter a protected area (polygon).

```python
# The filter expression to find geometries that cross a line string.
filter = "ST_CROSSES(geo_field, 'LINESTRING(5 0, 5 10)')"
```

## ST_INTERSECTS / st_intersects

The `ST_INTERSECTS` operator returns `TRUE` if two geometries have any point of their boundaries or interiors in common. This is a general-purpose operator for detecting any form of spatial overlap.

**Example**

If you have a collection of roads and want to find all roads that cross or touch a specific line string representing a proposed new road, you can use `ST_INTERSECTS`.

```python
# The filter expression to find geometries that intersect with a specific line string.
filter = "ST_INTERSECTS(geo_field, 'LINESTRING (1 1, 2 2)')"
```

## ST_OVERLAPS / st_overlaps

The `ST_OVERLAPS` operator returns `TRUE` if two geometries of the same dimension have a partial intersection, where the intersection itself has the same dimension as the original geometries, but is not equal to either of them.

**Example**

You have a set of overlapping sales regions and want to find all regions that partially overlap with a new proposed sales zone.

```python
# The filter expression to find geometries that partially overlap with a polygon.
filter = "ST_OVERLAPS(geo_field, 'POLYGON((0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 0, 0 0))')"
```

## ST_TOUCHES / st_touches

The `ST_TOUCHES` operator returns `TRUE` if two geometries' boundaries touch, but their interiors do not intersect. This is useful for detecting adjacencies.

**Example**

If you have a map of property parcels and want to find all parcels that are directly adjacent to a public park without any overlap.

```python
# The filter expression to find geometries that only touch a line string at their boundaries.
filter = "ST_TOUCHES(geo_field, 'LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1)')"
```

## ST_WITHIN / st_within

The `ST_WITHIN` operator returns `TRUE` if the first geometry is completely within the interior or on the boundary of the second geometry. It is the inverse of `ST_CONTAINS`.

**Example**

You want to find all small residential areas that are located entirely within a larger designated park area.

```python
# The filter expression to find geometries that are completely within a larger polygon.
filter = "ST_WITHIN(geo_field, 'POLYGON((110 38, 115 38, 115 42, 110 42, 110 38))')"
```

For more information on how to use a `GEOMETRY` field, refer to [Geometry Field](geometry-field.md).

## ST_DWITHIN / st_dwithin

The `ST_DWITHIN` operator returns `TRUE` if the distance between geometry A and geometry B is less than or equal to a specified value (in meters). Currently, geometry B must be a point.

**Example**

Suppose you have a collection of store locations and want to find all stores within 5,000 meters of a specific customerâ€™s location.

```python
# Find all stores within 5000 meters of the point (120 30)
filter = "ST_DWITHIN(geo_field, 'POINT(120 30)', 5000)"
```
