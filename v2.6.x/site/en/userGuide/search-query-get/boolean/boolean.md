# Filtering Explained

Milvus provides powerful filtering capabilities that enable precise querying of your data. Filter expressions allow you to target specific scalar fields and refine search results with different conditions. This guide explains how to use filter expressions in Milvus, with examples focused on query operations. You can also apply these filters in search and delete requests.

## Basic operators

Milvus supports several basic operators for filtering data:

- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` allow filtering based on numeric or text fields.

- **Range Filters**: `IN` and `LIKE` help match specific value ranges or sets.

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `**` are used for calculations involving numeric fields.

- **Logical Operators**: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` combine multiple conditions into complex expressions.

### Example: Filtering by Color

To find entities with primary colors (red, green, or blue) in a scalar field `color`, use the following filter expression:

```python
filter='color in ["red", "green", "blue"]'
```

### Example: Filtering JSON Fields

Milvus allows referencing keys in JSON fields. For instance, if you have a JSON field `product` with keys `price` and `model`, and want to find products with a specific model and price lower than 1,850, use this filter expression:

```python
filter='product["model"] == "JSN-087" AND product["price"] < 1850'
```

### Example: Filtering Array Fields

If you have an array field `history_temperatures` containing the records of average temperatures reported by observatories since the year 2000, and want to find observatories where the temperature in 2009 (the 10th recorded ) exceeds 23°C, use this expression:

```python
filter='history_temperatures[10] > 23'
```

For more information on these basic operators, refer to [Basic Operators](basic-operators.md).

## Filter expression templates

When filtering using CJK characters, processing can be more complex due to their larger character sets and encoding differences. This can result in slower performance, especially with the `IN` operator.

Milvus introduces filter expression templating to optimize performance when working with CJK characters. By separating dynamic values from the filter expression, the query engine handles parameter insertion more efficiently.

### Example

To find individuals over the age of 25 living in either "北京" (Beijing) or "上海" (Shanghai), use the following template expression:

```python
filter = "age > 25 AND city IN ['北京', '上海']"
```

To improve performance, use this variation with parameters:

```python
filter = "age > {age} AND city in {city}",
filter_params = {"age": 25, "city": ["北京", "上海"]}
```

This approach reduces parsing overhead and improves query speed. For more information, see [Filter Templating](filtering-templating.md).

## Data type-specific operators

Milvus provides advanced filtering operators for specific data types, such as JSON, ARRAY, and VARCHAR fields.

### JSON field-specific operators

Milvus offers advanced operators for querying JSON fields, enabling precise filtering within complex JSON structures:

`JSON_CONTAINS(identifier, jsonExpr)`: Checks if a JSON expression exists in the field.

```python
# JSON data: {"tags": ["electronics", "sale", "new"]}
filter='json_contains(tags, "sale")'
```

`JSON_CONTAINS_ALL(identifier, jsonExpr)`: Ensures all elements of the JSON expression are present.

```python
# JSON data: {"tags": ["electronics", "sale", "new", "discount"]}
filter='json_contains_all(tags, ["electronics", "sale", "new"])'
```

`JSON_CONTAINS_ANY(identifier, jsonExpr)`: Filters for entities where at least one element exists in the JSON expression.

```python
# JSON data: {"tags": ["electronics", "sale", "new"]}
filter='json_contains_any(tags, ["electronics", "new", "clearance"])'
```

For more details on JSON operators, refer to [JSON Operators](json-operators.md).

### ARRAY field-specific operators

Milvus provides advanced filtering operators for array fields, such as `ARRAY_CONTAINS`, `ARRAY_CONTAINS_ALL`, `ARRAY_CONTAINS_ANY`, and `ARRAY_LENGTH`, which allow fine-grained control over array data:

`ARRAY_CONTAINS`: Filters entities containing a specific element.

```python
filter="ARRAY_CONTAINS(history_temperatures, 23)"
```

`ARRAY_CONTAINS_ALL`: Filters entities where all elements in a list are present.

```python
filter="ARRAY_CONTAINS_ALL(history_temperatures, [23, 24])"
```

`ARRAY_CONTAINS_ANY`: Filters entities containing any element from the list.

```python
filter="ARRAY_CONTAINS_ANY(history_temperatures, [23, 24])"
```

`ARRAY_LENGTH`: Filters based on the length of the array.

```python
filter="ARRAY_LENGTH(history_temperatures) < 10"
```

For more details on array operators, see [ARRAY Operators](array-operators.md).

### VARCHAR field-specific operators

Milvus provides specialized operators for precise text-based searches on VARCHAR fields:

#### `TEXT_MATCH` operator

The `TEXT_MATCH` operator allows precise document retrieval based on specific query terms. It is particularly useful for filtered searches that combine scalar filters with vector similarity searches. Unlike semantic searches, Text Match focuses on exact term occurrences.

Milvus uses Tantivy to support inverted indexing and term-based text search. The process involves:

1. **Analyzer**: Tokenizes and processes input text.

1. **Indexing**: Creates an inverted index mapping unique tokens to documents.

For more details, refer to [Text Match](keyword-match.md).

#### `PHRASE_MATCH` operator | Milvus 2.6.x

The **PHRASE_MATCH** operator enables precise retrieval of documents based on exact phrase matches, considering both the order and adjacency of query terms.

For more details, refer to [Phrase Match](phrase-match.md).

## Random sampling operator | Milvus 2.6.x

Random sampling allows you to extract a subset of data samples from a collection at the segment level, making it ideal for exploring and processing massive datasets. This feature is valuable for these use cases:

- **Quick data preview**: It returns representative sample data with minimal resource usage, which allows you to quickly grasp the overall structure and content of large vector datasets.

- **Combined filtering**: When performing multi-criteria filtering (e.g., selecting documents by attributes), combining it with random sampling enables quick statistical summaries and previews on the filtered results.

- **Resource saving in large-scale data processing**: For very large datasets, aggregating and analyzing full data can be resource-intensive. Random sampling reduces the processing load by lowering the amount of data handled.

Use the following syntax for random sampling:

```python
filter = RANDOM_SAMPLE(float)
```

- `float`**:** A sampling factor in the range (0, 1), excluding the boundaries. For example, `RANDOM_SAMPLE(0.001)` selects approximately 0.1% of the results.

<div class="alert note">

The `RANDOM_SAMPLE` expression is case-insensitive. You can use either `RANDOM_SAMPLE` or `random_sample`.

</div>

### Combine with other filters

The random sampling operator must be combined with other filtering expressions using logical `AND`. For example:

```python
filter = "color = 'red' and RANDOM_SAMPLE(0.001)"
```

Here, Milvus first applies the condition `color = 'red'` and then performs random sampling on the result set.

### Example: Random sampling without an additional filter

In this example, the query samples a random subset (approximately 1%) of the entire data in the specified collection:

```python
filter = "RANDOM_SAMPLE(0.01)"

result = MilvusClient.query(
    collection_name="YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME",
    filter=filter, 
    output_fields=["id"]
)
```

### Example: Combined filtering with random sampling

In this example, the query first filters documents based on a specific attribute (in this case, documents where `color` equals `'red'`). After filtering, the random sampling operator is applied to return roughly 0.1% of the filtered results:

```python
filter = "color = 'red' and RANDOM_SAMPLE(0.001)"

result = MilvusClient.query(
    collection_name="YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME",
    filter=filter, 
    output_fields=["id"]
)
```
