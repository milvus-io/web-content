# MetricType

This is an enumeration that provides the following constants.

## Constants

- INVALID

    Sets the metric type to **INVALID**.

- L2

    Sets the metric type to **L2**. This applies to float vectors only.

- IP

    Sets the metric type to **IP**. This applies to float vectors only.

- COSINE

    Sets the metric type to **COSINE**. This applies to float vectors only.

- HAMMING

    Sets the metric type to **HAMMING**. This applies to binary vectors only.

- JACCARD

    Sets the metric type to **JACCARD**. This applies to binary vectors only.

- BM25

    Sets the metric type to **BM25**. This applies to sparse vector fields derived from BM25 functions.

- MAX_SIM

    Sets the metric type to **MAX_SIM**. This applies only to all vectors in Struct elements.
