# MetricType

This is an enumeration that provides the following constants.

- **L2**

    Sets the metric type to Euclidean distance (L2). This applies only to float vectors.

- **IP**

    Sets the metric type to inner product (IP). This applies only to float vectors.

- **COSINE**

    Sets the metric type to COSINE. This applies only to float vectors.

- **HAMMING**

    Sets the metric type to HAMMING. This applies only to binary vectors.

- **JACCARD**

    Sets the metric type to JACCARD. This applies only to binary vectors.

- **BM25**

    Sets the metric type to BM25. This applies only to sparse vectors.
