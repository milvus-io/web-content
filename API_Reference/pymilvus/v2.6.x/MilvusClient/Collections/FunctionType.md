# FunctionType

This is an enumeration that provides the following constants.

## Constants

-  BM25 = 1

    Sets the function type to **BM25**. This indicates that Milvus will utilize the BM25 algorithm to generate sparse embeddings for a designated `VARCHAR` field.

- UNKNOWN = 999

    Sets the data type to **Unknown**.
