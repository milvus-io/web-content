# \_\_call\_\_()

This operation in [CrossEncoderRerankFunction](CrossEncoderRerankFunction.md) takes in a query and document strings and returns a list of `RerankResult` objects with the top k documents ranked by score.

## Request syntax

```python
# Instance created
ce_rf = CrossEncoderRerankFunction()

# __call__ method will be called
ce_rf(
    query: str,
    documents: List[str],
    top_k: int = 5
) -> List[RerankResult]
```

**PARAMETERS:**

- `query` (*string*)

    The query string to use for ranking.

- `documents` (*List[str]*)

    A list of document strings that will be ranked for the given query.

- `top_k` (*int*)

    The maximum number of top ranked documents to return. Defaults to **5**.

**RETURN TYPE:**

*List[RerankResult]*

**RETURNS:**

A list of `RerankResult` objects.

```plaintext
├── RerankResult
|    └── text
|    └── score
|    └── index
```

Each `RerankResult` object contains:

- `text`: The matched document text.

- `score`: The score assigned to that document by the reranking model.

- `index`: The index of the document in the original documents list.

**EXCEPTIONS:**

- **ImportError**

    This exception will be raised when the Sentence Transformer module is not installed.

## Examples

```python
from pymilvus.model.reranker import CrossEncoderRerankFunction

# Define the rerank function
ce_rf = CrossEncoderRerankFunction(
    model_name="cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",  # Specify the model name. Defaults to an emtpy string.
    device="cpu" # Specify the device to use, e.g., 'cpu' or 'cuda:0'
)
