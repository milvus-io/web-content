# Troubleshooting
This page lists common issues that may occur when running Milvus, as well as possible troubleshooting tips. Issues on this page fall into the following categories:

- [Boot issues](troubleshooting.md#Boot-issues)
- [Runtime issues](troubleshooting.md#Runtime-issues)
- [API issues](troubleshooting.md#API-issues)
- [etcd crash issues](troubleshooting.md#etcd-crash-issues)


  ## Boot issues

  Boot errors are usually fatal. Run the following command to view error details:

  ```
  $ docker logs <your milvus container id>
  ```


  ## Runtime issues

  Errors that occur during runtime may cause service breakdown. To troubleshoot this issue, check compatibility between the server and your client before moving forward.


  ## API issues

  These issues occur during API method calls between the Milvus server and your client. They will be returned to the client synchronously or asynchronously.
  

  ## etcd crash issues
  
  ### 1. etcd pod pending

  The etcd cluster uses pvc by default. StorageClass needs to be preconfigured for the Kubernetes cluster.

  ### 2. etcd pod crash

  When an etcd pod crashes with `Error: bad member ID arg (strconv.ParseUint: parsing "": invalid syntax), expecting ID in Hex`, you can log into this pod and delete the `/bitnami/etcd/data/member_id` file.

  ### 3. Multiple pods keep crashing while `etcd-0` is still running

  You can run the following code if multiple pods keeps crashing while `etcd-0` is still running.
  
  ```
  kubectl scale sts <etcd-sts> --replicas=1
  # delete the pvc for etcd-1 and etcd-2
  kubectl scale sts <etcd-sts> --replicas=3
  ```
  
  ### 4. All pods crash
  
  When all pods crash, try copying the `/bitnami/etcd/data/member/snap/db` file. Use `https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt` to modify database data.

  All Milvus metadata are kept in the `key` bucket. Back up the data in this bucket and run the following commands. Note that the prefix data in the `by-dev/meta/session` file does not require a backup.
  
  ```
  kubectl kubectl scale sts <etcd-sts> --replicas=0
  # delete the pvc for etcd-0, etcd-1, etcd-2
  kubectl kubectl scale sts <etcd-sts> --replicas=1
  # restore the backup data
  ```
