# In-memory Index

This topic lists various types of in-memory indexes Milvus supports, scenarios each of them best suits, and parameters users can configure to achieve better search performance. For on-disk indexes, see **[On-disk Index](disk_index.md)**.

Indexing is the process of efficiently organizing data, and it plays a major role in making similarity search useful by dramatically accelerating time-consuming queries on large datasets. 

To improve query performance, you can [specify an index type](build_index.md) for each vector field. 

<div class="alert note"> 
Currently, a vector field only supports one index type. Milvus automatically deletes the old index when switching the index type.
</div>


## ANNS vector indexes

Most of the vector index types supported by Milvus use approximate nearest neighbors search (ANNS) algorithms. Compared with accurate retrieval, which is usually very time-consuming, the core idea of ANNS is no longer limited to returning the most accurate result, but only searching for neighbors of the target. ANNS improves retrieval efficiency by sacrificing accuracy within an acceptable range.

According to the implementation methods, the ANNS vector index can be divided into four categories:

- Tree-based index
- Graph-based index
- Hash-based index
- Quantization-based index


## Indexes supported in Milvus

According to the suited data type, the supported indexes in Milvus can be divided into two categories:
- Indexes for floating-point embeddings:
  - For 128-dimensional floating-point embeddings, the storage they take up is 128 * the size of float = 512 bytes. And the [distance metrics](metric.md) used for float-point embeddings are Euclidean distance (L2) and Inner product. 
  - This type of indexes include FLAT, IVF_FLAT, IVF_PQ, IVF_SQ8, ANNOY, and HNSW.
- Indexes for binary embeddings
  - For 128-dimensional binary embeddings, the storage they take up is 128 / 8 = 16 bytes. And the distance metrics used for binary embeddings are Jaccard, Tanimoto, Hamming, Superstructure, and Substructure.
  - This type of indexes include BIN_FLAT and BIN_IVF_FLAT.

The following table classifies the indexes that Milvus supports:

### FLAT


For vector similarity search applications that require perfect accuracy and depend on relatively small (million-scale) datasets, the FLAT index is a good choice. FLAT does not compress vectors, and is the only index that can guarantee exact search results. Results from FLAT can also be used as a point of comparison for results produced by other indexes that have less than 100% recall.

FLAT is accurate because it takes an exhaustive approach to search, which means for each query the target input is compared to every vector in a dataset. This makes FLAT the slowest index on our list, and poorly suited for querying massive vector data. There are no parameters for the FLAT index in Milvus, and using it does not require data training or additional storage.

- Search parameters

  | Parameter     | Description                            | Range                               |
  | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | `metric_type` | [Optional] The chosen distance metric. | See [Supported Metrics](metric.md). |

### IVF_FLAT


IVF_FLAT divides vector data into `nlist` cluster units, and then compares distances between the target input vector and the center of each cluster. Depending on the number of clusters the system is set to query (`nprobe`), similarity search results are returned based on comparisons between the target input and the vectors in the most similar cluster(s) only — drastically reducing query time.

By adjusting `nprobe`, an ideal balance between accuracy and speed can be found for a given scenario. Results from the [IVF_FLAT performance test](https://zilliz.com/blog/Accelerating-Similarity-Search-on-Really-Big-Data-with-Vector-Indexing) demonstrate that query time increases sharply as both the number of target input vectors (`nq`), and the number of clusters to search (`nprobe`), increase.

IVF_FLAT is the most basic IVF index, and the encoded data stored in each unit is consistent with the original data.

 - Index building parameters

   | Parameter | Description             | Range      |
   | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
   | `nlist`   | Number of cluster units | [1, 65536] |


- Search parameters

  | Parameter | Description              | Range                                           |
  | --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | `nprobe`  | Number of units to query | CPU: [1, nlist] <br> GPU: [1, min(2048, nlist)] |

### IVF_SQ8


IVF_FLAT does not perform any compression, so the index files it produces are roughly the same size as the original, raw non-indexed vector data. For example, if the original 1B SIFT dataset is 476 GB, its IVF_FLAT index files will be slightly smaller (~470 GB). Loading all the index files into memory will consume 470 GB of storage.

When disk, CPU, or GPU memory resources are limited, IVF_SQ8 is a better option than IVF_FLAT. This index type can convert each FLOAT (4 bytes) to UINT8 (1 byte) by performing scalar quantization. This reduces disk, CPU, and GPU memory consumption by 70–75%. For the 1B SIFT dataset, the IVF_SQ8 index files require just 140 GB of storage.

   | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |

  | Parameter | Description              | Range                                           |
  | --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | `nprobe`  | Number of units to query | CPU: [1, nlist] <br> GPU: [1, min(2048, nlist)] |

### IVF_PQ


`PQ` (Product Quantization) uniformly decomposes the original high-dimensional vector space into Cartesian products of `m` low-dimensional vector spaces, and then quantizes the decomposed low-dimensional vector spaces. Instead of calculating the distances between the target vector and the center of all the units, product quantization enables the calculation of distances between the target vector and the clustering center of each low-dimensional space and greatly reduces the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

IVF\_PQ performs IVF index clustering before quantizing the product of vectors. Its index file is even smaller than IVF\_SQ8, but it also causes a loss of accuracy during searching vectors.

### HNSW

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) is a graph-based indexing algorithm. It builds a multi-layer navigation structure for an image according to certain rules. In this structure, the upper layers are more sparse and the distances between nodes are farther; the lower layers are denser and the distances between nodes are closer. The search starts from the uppermost layer, finds the node closest to the target in this layer, and then enters the next layer to begin another search. After multiple iterations, it can quickly approach the target position.

In order to improve performance, HNSW limits the maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph to `M`. In addition, you can use `efConstruction` (when building index) or `ef` (when searching targets) to specify a search range.

- Index building parameters

  | Parameter        | Description                | Range    |
  | ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
  | `M`              | Maximum degree of the node | [4, 64]  |
  | `efConstruction` | Search scope               | [8, 512] |


- Search parameters

  | Parameter | Description  | Range            |
  | --------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
  | `ef`      | Search scope | [`top_k`, 32768] |


### ANNOY


ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is an index that uses a hyperplane to divide a high-dimensional space into multiple subspaces, and then stores them in a tree structure.

There are just two main parameters needed to tune ANNOY: the number of trees `n_trees` and the number of nodes to inspect during searching `search_k`.

- `n_trees` is provided during build time and affects the build time and the index size. A larger value will give more accurate results, but larger indexes.

- `search_k` is provided in runtime and affects the search performance. A larger value will give more accurate results, but will take longer time to return.
  
If `search_k` is not provided, it will default to `n * n_trees` where `n` is the number of approximate nearest neighbors. Otherwise, `search_k` and `n_trees` are roughly independent, i.e. the value of `n_trees` will not affect search time if `search_k` is held constant and vice versa. Basically it's recommended to set `n_trees` as large as possible given the amount of memory you can afford, and it's recommended to set `search_k` as large as possible given the time constraints you have for the queries.


- Index building parameters

  | Parameter | Description                              | Range     |
  | --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
  | `n_trees` | The number of trees.                     | [1, 1024] |

  | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
  | `search_k` | The parameters that controls the search scope.               | [k, inf] |

## FAQ


<details>
<summary><font color="#4fc4f9">What is the difference between FLAT index and IVF_FLAT index?</font></summary>
<p>IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into <code>nlist</code> clusters. If you keep the default value of <code>nlist</code> as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get <code>nprobe</code> nearest clusters. Then Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the vectors in the selected clusters to get the nearest vectors. Unlike IVF_FLAT, FLAT directly compares the distances between the target vector and each and every vector.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when the total number of vectors approximately equals <code>nlist</code>, IVF_FLAT and FLAT has little difference in the way of calculation required and search performance. But as the number of vectors grows to two times, three times, or n times of <code>nlist</code>, IVF_FLAT index begins to show increasingly greater advantages.
