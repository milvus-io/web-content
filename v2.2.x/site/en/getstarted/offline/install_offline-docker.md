# Install Milvus Offline with Docker Compose

This topic describes how to install Milvus with Docker Compose in an offline environment. 

Installation of Milvus might fail due to image loading errors. You can install Milvus in an offline environment to avoid such problem.

## Download files and images

To install Milvus offline, you need to pull and save all images in an online environment first, and then transfer them to the target host and load them manually.

1. Download an installation file.

- For Milvus standalone:

```
$ wget https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.2.9/milvus-standalone-docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml
```

- For Milvus cluster:

```
$ wget https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/download/v2.2.9/milvus-cluster-docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml

```

2. Download requirement and script files.

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/deployments/offline/requirements.txt
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/deployments/offline/save_image.py
```

3. Pull and save images.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 save_image.py --manifest docker-compose.yml
```

<div class="alert note">
  The images are stored in the <code>/images</code> folder.
  </div>


4. Load the images.

```bash
cd images/; for image in $(find . -type f -name "*.tar.gz") ; do gunzip -c $image | docker load; done
```

## Install Milvus offline

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
