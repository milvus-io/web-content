# Milvus Overview

## What is Milvus

Milvus is an open source similarity search engine for massive feature vectors. Designed with heterogeneous computing architecture for the best cost efficiency. Searches over billion-scale vectors take only milliseconds with minimum computing resources.

## Key features

- Heterogeneous computing

  Milvus is designed with heterogeneous computing architecture for the best performance and cost efficiency. 

- Multiple indexes

  Milvus supports a variety of indexing types that employs quantization, tree-based, and graph indexing techniques. 

- Intelligent resource management

  Milvus automatically adapts search computation and index building processes based on your datasets and available resources.

- Horizontal scalability

  Milvus supports online / offline expansion to scale both storage and computation resources with simple commands.

- High availability

  Milvus is integrated with Kubernetes framework so that all single point of failures could be avoided.

- High compatibility

  Milvus is compatible with almost all deep learning models and major programming languages such as Python, Java and C++, etc.

- Ease of use

  Milvus can be easily installed in a few steps and enables you to exclusively focus on feature vectors. 

- Visualized monitor

  You can track system performance on Prometheus-based GUI monitor dashboards.
