# Product Benefits


## GPU-accelerated search engine

Milvus is designed to process massvie feature vectors with heterogeneous computing architecture utilizing both GPUs and CPUs, which enables 1000 times faster vector sarching speed. 


## Smart index, with high scalability

With a “Decide Your Own Algorithm” approach, machine learning and advanced algorithms can be embeded into Milvus without the headache of complex data engineering or migrating data between systems. Milvus provides multiple vector index types based on different algorithms: quantization based, tree-graph based and graph based. Indexes can be decided by machine learning models that serve your application best.

Loose coupling design for computation and storage architecture allows Milvus to be easily expanded with minimum administration effort.


## Ease of use

With Milvus, you can focus on your AI applications, rather than managing the vector search system. Data will be ready for searching immediately with superior ad-hoc performance.

Installation is a breeze, it can be completed in minutes. System performnace can be monitored real-time on Prometheus-based GUI dashboard. 

Milvus is designed to be "easy to use". To start your first vector search program, please go to https://milvus.io/docs/en/QuickStart/.
