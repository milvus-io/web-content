### Contributing to the Blog

The articles in Milvus Blog are generated from [this markdown sources](https://github.com/milvus-io/community/tree/master/blog). 

If you want to write an article intended for the Blog, please [open an issue in the community repository](https://github.com/milvus-io/community/issues/new). In most cases, you might want to share your article on your own blog or other writing medium instead. It's worth asking, though, in case we find your article is a good fit for the Blog.

### About our docs

The Milvus documentation is written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/). 

Not all technical content on milvus.io is located in this repo. Some projects have their own repositories and project-specific documentation. 

The SDK reference is generated from the source code located in [pymilvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus) and [milvus-sdk-java](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-java) repositories.
