  Boot errors are usually fatal. Run the following command to view error details:

  ```console
  $ docker logs <your milvus container id>
  ```

<a href="#runtime_issues"></a>
  ## Runtime issues

  Errors that occur during runtime may cause service breakdown. To troubleshoot this issue, check compatibility between the server and your client before moving forward.

  These issues occur during API method calls between the Milvus server and your client. They will be returned to the client synchronously or asynchronously.
