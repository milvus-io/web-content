# ASCII folding​

The `asciifolding`** **filter converts characters outside the [Basic Latin Unicode block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block)) (the first 127 ASCII characters) into their ASCII equivalents. For instance, it transforms characters like `í` to `i`, making text processing simpler and more consistent, especially for multilingual content.​

## Configuration​

The `asciifolding` filter is built into Milvus. To use it, simply specify its name in the `filter` section within `analyzer_params`.​

```python
analyzer_params = {​
    "tokenizer": "standard",​
    "filter": ["asciifolding"],​
}​
```

The `asciifolding` filter operates on the terms generated by the tokenizer, so it must be used in combination with a tokenizer.

After defining `analyzer_params`, you can apply them to a `VARCHAR` field when defining a collection schema. This allows Milvus to process the text in that field using the specified analyzer for efficient tokenization and filtering. For details, refer to [Example use](analyzer-overview.md#Example-use).​

## Example output​

Here’s an example of how the `asciifolding` filter processes text:​

**Original text**:​

```python
"Café Möller serves crème brûlée and piñatas."​
```

**Expected output**:​

```python
["Cafe", "Moller", "serves", "creme", "brulee", "and", "pinatas"]​
```
