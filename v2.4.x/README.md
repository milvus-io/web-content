# Milvus Documentation

Welcome to Milvus documentation!

This repository contains technical documentation for [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), the world's most advanced open-source vector database. Visit [Milvus.io](https://milvus.io/docs) or [Web content repo](https://github.com/milvus-io/web-content) for fully rendered documents.

Each branch corresponds to a Milvus release by name. We've set the branch of the latest Milvus release as the default branch. For documentation of a different Milvus release, switch to the corresponding branch.
